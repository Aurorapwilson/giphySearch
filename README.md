# giphySearch
is utilizing the Giphy API database and searching for Marvel character Gifs. 

Initially there is an array of Marvel characters that were dynamically created with jquery. 

Next, the buttons are linked to our Ajax call through a onClick function. When each button is clicked the Ajax function is called and returns 10 relevant Gifs. 

You can also search for other Marvel characters through our input bar and search button. 

The new characters call the Ajax Functions and each character search returns 10 Gifs.
